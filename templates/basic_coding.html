      <h2>What is Basic Coding?</h2>
      <p>Here are some basic coding pointers to keep in mind:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Start with a plan: </strong> Before you start coding, make sure you have a clear plan for what you want to achieve. This can help you stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked.</li>
        <li><strong>Use descriptive variable names: </strong> When naming variables, use descriptive names that make it clear what the variable is for. This can make your code more readable and easier to understand.</li>
        <li><strong>Write modular code:</strong> Break your code down into smaller, modular pieces that perform specific functions. This can make your code more reusable and easier to maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Comment your code:</strong>Adding comments to your code can help others understand what you're trying to accomplish, and can also help you remember what you were thinking when you wrote the code.</li>
        <li><strong>Test your code:</strong>Always test your code thoroughly before deploying it. This can help you catch any bugs or errors before they become bigger problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep learning:</strong> Technology is constantly evolving, so it's important to keep learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't be afraid to ask for help:</strong> If you're stuck on a coding problem, don't be afraid to ask for help from more experienced coders or online communities. There's no shame in asking for help, and it can help you learn faster and avoid getting stuck for too long.</li>
