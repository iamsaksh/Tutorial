      <h2>What is AI and ML?</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are two closely related fields that involve the development of algorithms and computer programs that can perform tasks that typically require human-like intelligence, such as recognizing images, understanding natural language, and making decisions based on data.</p>

<h3>AI:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AI is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques used to build intelligent computer systems.</li>
  <li>The goal of AI is to develop machines that can simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that normally require human cognition.</li>
  <li>AI can be further categorized into two sub-fields: narrow or weak AI, which is designed to perform a single task or set of tasks, and general or strong AI, which is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can.</li>
  <li>Examples of AI include chatbots, recommendation systems, and self-driving cars.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ML:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ML is a subset of AI that focuses specifically on the development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time.</li>
  <li>The goal of ML is to enable machines to learn from experience and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.</li>
  <li>ML can be further categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
  <li>Examples of ML include image recognition, natural language processing, and fraud detection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>AI and ML:</h3>
<p>Overall, AI and ML are rapidly growing fields that are transforming the way we interact with technology and making it possible for machines to perform tasks that were once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans.</p>
