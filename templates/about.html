		<h1>About HTML, Web Development, AI-ML, and Basic Coding Tutorials</h1>
		<p>Welcome to our HTML tutorial, where we'll guide you through the basics of HTML coding. HTML is a markup language used to create web pages, and is an essential skill for anyone interested in web development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder looking to brush up on your skills, this tutorial is perfect for you.</p>

		<p>But that's not all! We also offer tutorials on web development, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), and basic coding. Here are some key points to help you differentiate between these topics:</p>

		<ul>


	<li>Web development involves building and maintaining websites and web applications using a variety of tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web development frameworks, content management systems, and more.</li>
	<li>Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques used to build intelligent computer systems. The goal of AI is to develop machines that can simulate human intelligence and perform tasks that normally require human cognition.</li>
	<li>Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses specifically on the development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance over time. ML can be further categorized into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</li>
	<li>Basic coding covers the fundamental concepts and principles of programming, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and more. These concepts are the building blocks of programming and are essential for any aspiring coder to master.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether you're interested in learning HTML, web development, AI-ML, or basic coding, we've got you covered. At the end of each tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation in the topic and be ready to tackle more advanced topics. So why wait? Get started today!</p>
